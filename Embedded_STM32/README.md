# C Embedded Labs
This repository contains C embedded code for various tasks, primarily focused on STM32 microcontrollers.
# Lab 1: Toggle LEDs:
## Task 1: Toggle All LEDs
**Description:** Toggles all LEDs connected to the microcontroller pin.

## Task 2: Blink LEDs Alternately
**Description:** Blinks four LEDs alternately with a variable blinking period. The blinking period can be adjusted using the debugger.

## Task 3: Sequential LED Blinking
**Description:** Toggles the state of four LEDs in sequence - red, yellow, green, and blue - with a specified delay between each toggle. The LEDs blink continuously in the specified sequence until the program is terminated.

# Lab 2: Push buttons:
This repository contains C embedded code for various tasks involving push button presses and LED toggling on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Task 1: Blink LED After Button Presses
**Description:** Starts blinking the LED after a certain number of button presses. Continues counting the number of presses and turns off the LED when the count reaches a specific value.

## Task 2: Indicate Button Presses on LEDs
**Description:** Detects the number of times (up to 7) a push button was pressed and indicates this number of presses in binary on 3 LEDs.

## Task 3: Toggle LED Based on Button Press Duration
**Description:** Toggles the LED if the push button was shortly pressed. If the button is pressed and held for 5 seconds, the LED starts blinking.
