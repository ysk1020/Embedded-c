# C Embedded Labs
This repository contains C embedded code for various tasks, primarily focused on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Task 1: Toggle LEDs
Description: Toggles three LEDs with different frequencies using software delays and Timer interrupts.

## Task 2: Blink LEDs Alternately
Description: Blinks four LEDs alternately with a variable blinking period. The blinking period can be adjusted using the debugger.

## Task 3: Sequential LED Blinking
Description: Toggles the state of four LEDs in sequence (red, yellow, green, blue) with a specified delay between each toggle.

## Task 4: Button Press Detection
Description: Detects button presses and performs different actions based on the number of presses. The LED blinks a specific number of times if a certain condition is met.

## Task 5: Binary Representation of Button Presses
Description: Displays the number of button presses in binary on three LEDs. Each LED represents a binary digit.

## Task 6: LED Toggle on Button Press
Description: Toggles an LED if the push button is shortly pressed. If the button is held for 5 seconds, the LED starts blinking.

## Task 7: Push Button Counter
Description: Counts the number of presses of two push buttons using EXTI interrupts. If the second button is pressed twice, an LED blinks a number of times equal to the count of the first button presses.
